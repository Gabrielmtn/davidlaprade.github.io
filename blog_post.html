What is a bad practice?

I'm not talking about examples. I mean: what makes a practice bad? In virtue of what is it bad? What does the badness of a practice supervene on? Etc. I assume these all ask the same question. But I suppose I could just say that the term "bad practice" is unclear. (Not ambiguous, nor vague. But unclear.) And given the number of times it gets thrown around in person and on the web, and given the normative force it appears to carry, I think it's worth the time getting clear on it. So, what I want is a minimal set of characteristics C, such that if a practice has some member of C, then that practice is bad. What might these characteristics be?


what about adding a .with_index post?
could talk about how the Enumerator class has been really cool
talk about the benefits of .map and .map!
it's inconvent because sometimes you want to factor in the object's index
enter .map.with_index, .collect.with_index
Other neat enumerator methods: .each_index, .flat_map
