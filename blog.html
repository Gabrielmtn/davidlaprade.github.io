				<h3 class="post_title">Changing Yo Self</h3>
				<p class="post_date">Date: 9.18.14</p>
				<div class="post_content">
					<p>I've always been curious as to why Ruby allows me to change <code>self</code> in this way:</p>
					<div class="code_block">self.map! {|x| x*2}</div>
					<p>And in this way:</p>
					<div class="code_block">self.replace(self.map {|x| x*2})</div>
					<p>But not in this way:</p>
					<div class="code_block">self = self.map {|x| x*2}</div>
					<p>In other words: I've been curious as to why Ruby allows you to change the self object's attributes, but not which object the "self" variable points to. Why do this?</p>
					<p>One suggestion that I often get is that it would be bad practice to change the referent of the <code>self</code> variable, and that this is why Ruby doesn't allow it. If you were to change the value of the variable mid-method, say, then it wouldn't be clear which object later occurences of <code>self</code> should point to. The computer wouldn't know. Should it point to the old object, or the new object? That's bad! But, obviously, we could resolve this issue just by hard-coding it into the language that later references always point to the new object. This doesn't really seem that big of an issue. Plus, there are plenty of bad practices that Ruby allows. See for example <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/ruby/excerpts/ruby-best-practices/worst-practices.html">these</a>. So this would leave unexplained why all of them are allowed in Ruby, but not this one. Nor does the "bad-practice" response explain why every other language (that I know of) has the same restriction built into it. This seems like something worse than bad practice. Seems like this must be <i>catastrophic</i> practice. But why?</p>
					<p>This might get us closer to an explanation, though perhaps still falls short. Suppose you have the following:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					class Matrix<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def change_self<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self = 4<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return self.orthogonal?<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
					end
					</div>
					<p>And suppose Ruby allowed this to happen, and that you actually call this method on a Matrix object. If so, then when <code>self = 4</code> was run, you would not only have changed the object, but you would have changed the <i>kind</i> of object that <code>self</code> points to. Now all of a sudden you are using a Matrix method on an Integer object! This seems bad, as it seems to undercut most of the point of ever having an object/class system in the first place--i.e. to put restrictions on which blocks of information can be altered by which functions. But even then, this doesn't seem totally catastrophic. Note that the next line of code is <code>self.orthogonal?</code>. But <code>#orthogonal</code> only belongs to the Matrix class. So, presumably, when you try to call <code>Matrix#orthogonal</code> on an Integer, you would just get an error anyway. End of problem. Where's the damage? I'm still not seeing why this should have been prevented from <i>every</i> language.</p>
					<p>The mystery remains!</p>

				<h3 class="post_title">Ruby's "with_object" Enumerator method</h3>
				<p class="post_date">Date: 9.12.14</p>
				<div class="post_content">
					<p>Suppose you want to create a new array from an old one--say, you want the new array to contain all and only those elements in the old array that are greater than 3. And suppose that the old array contains some elements that aren't greater than 3. So, for instance, the old array might be:</br>
					<div class="code_block">array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</div></p>

					<p>There are many reasons why something like <code>array.delete</code> isn't fit for this job. Reason (i): it requires you to pass in a value to delete from the array. And, in our case, we want to delete ANY value greater than 3--i.e. there might be far more values than we want/can specify! Reason (ii): <code>array.delete</code> changes the old array to create the new one. So, if you wanted to keep a record of what was in the old array, you'd have to do something like first create a duplicate. Inconveient. And finally, reason (iii): <code>array.delete</code> returns the value deleted, not the new array object--which is unhelpful when you're interested in stringing your functions together. (You are.)</p>

					<p>Ruby's "map" and "collect" methods don't really do the kind of work we're interested in either. By hypothesis, you want to dispose of some of the old elements. And all <code>array.map</code> and <code>array.collect</code> do is change certain members--they don't get rid of memebrs. Still, you could try something like this:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
						array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</br>
						new = []</br>
						array.map {|value| value > 3 ? new << value : value}<br><br>
						new => [4,5,6]
					</div>
					<p>But the core of this method once again doesn't return the new array object you're interested in. So this can't be strung together.</p>

					<p>Now, Ruby's <code>Array#find_all</code> method works well for the job just described since the objects that you want are in the old array.</p>
					<div class="code_block">
						array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</br>
						array.find_all {|x| x>3}<br><br>
						=> [4,5,6]
					</div>

					<p>But what if the new objects you want to include are not in the old array? What if you wanted the new array to contain just the objects in the old array greater than 3, multiplied by 2? To do this using <code>array.find_all</code>, you would need to tack on a .map function. For example:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</br>
					array.find_all {|x| x>3}.map {|x| x*2}<br><br>
					=> [8,10,12]
					</div>

					<p>And what if we wanted to append these new values to the end of another array?--say: to <code>[4, 6]</code>. We'd need to do something like:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</br>
					[4, 6] << array.find_all {|x| x>3}.map {|x| x*2}<br><br>
					=> [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
					</div>

					<p>This works well. But it would be nice if we could do everything in just one step. Enter the Enumerator method I have just discovered: "with_object". What "with_object" allows you to do is pass in an arbitrary object to the block, and then return that object afterwards. So, for example, we could pass <code>[4,6]</code> into the block directly, give it the name "o" and just put the items into it one by one as we iterate through the block, then get the modified object back. Like this:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</br>
					array.each.with_object([4,6]) {|x,o| o << x*2 if x>3}<br><br>
					=> [4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
					</div>

					<p>Very handy!</p>

					<p>The <code>Enumerator#with_object</code> method can also be used to elegantly perform tasks that would take a lot of code using just map and find. Suppose, for instance, that you wanted to find the coordinates of each occurence of a given object in a 2D array; e.g. if I wanted to find the coordinates of "foo" in:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [["foo", "bar", "lobster"], ["camel", "trombone", "foo"]]
					</div>

					<p>To do this using just map and find all, I would need to do something like this:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [["foo", "bar", "lobster"], ["camel", "trombone", "foo"]]<br><br>
					array.map.with_index{|row,row_index|<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;row.map.with_index {|v,col_index|<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v=="foo" ? [row_index,col_index] : v<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					}.flatten(1).find_all {|x| x.class==Array}<br><br>
					=> [[0,0],[1,2]]
					</div>

					<p>Inelegant, to say the least! But <code>Enumerator#with_object</code> affords a more direct solution:</p>
					<div class="code_block">
					array = [["foo", "bar", "lobster"], ["camel", "trombone", "foo"]]<br><br>
					array.each.with_index.with_object([]) {|(row, row_id), o|<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;row.each.with_index {|value, col_id| <br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o<<[row_id, col_id] if value == "foo"<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					}<br><br>
					=> [[0,0],[1,2]]
					</div>

					<p>Neat!</p>
